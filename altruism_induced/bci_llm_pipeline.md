# BCI → IASL → LLM Pipeline (Prosocial Modulation Path)

This document describes the placement and function of the Induced
Altruism Safety Layer (IASL) within the broader BCI → LLM cognitive
pipeline. IASL is a non-generative, ethically constrained module that
supports prosocial modulation through impulse stabilization, reflective
delay, and empathy-weight modulation.

IASL does not alter identity, values, or personal preferences. All
modulation is biologically reversible, and long-term behavioral change
may arise only through learning and reflection.

CEL → DUCL → PGP → LLM → Output

## 1. BCI Input Layer

The BCI subsystem provides:
- affective arousal markers,
- impulsivity indicators,
- cognitive load patterns,
- stress-related activation signatures.

BCI does not generate content.  
BCI provides raw signals for modulation.

---

## 2. IASL — Induced Altruism Safety Layer

IASL transforms BCI signals into:
- stabilized impulse profiles,
- reflective micro-pauses,
- increased salience of prosocial cues,
- reduced aggression-related activation.

IASL is:
- deterministic,
- reversible,
- transparent,
- non-coercive,
- non-generative.

IASL does not:
- impose values,
- modify personality,
- influence sexuality,
- override autonomy.

---

## 3. CEL — Child-Env Layer

CEL ensures:
- affective safety,
- pacing,
- overload detection,
- relational grounding.

IASL feeds CEL with stabilized, prosocially weighted signals.

---

## 4. DUCL — Dual-User Consent Layer

DUCL:
- merges contexts,
- enforces consent,
- resolves conflicts,
- protects autonomy.

IASL does not bypass DUCL.

---

## 5. PGP — Prosocial Guardrail Protocol

PGP ensures:
- ethical alignment,
- non-harm,
- relational safety,
- prosocial framing.

IASL supports PGP by reducing impulsive harm tendencies.

---

## 6. LLM Output

The LLM generates content under:
- CEL constraints,
- DUCL consent rules,
- PGP guardrails,
- IASL-modulated signal profile.

The LLM does not access raw BCI signals.  
The LLM does not perform modulation.  
The LLM receives only safe, pre-processed inputs.

---

## Summary

IASL is a safety and modulation layer that:
- stabilizes impulses,
- enhances reflection,
- supports prosocial behavior,
- preserves identity and autonomy,
- integrates cleanly with CEL/DUCL/PGP.

IASL is a support mechanism, not a control mechanism.
