# Ethical Framework for IASL (Induced Altruism Safety Layer)

The Induced Altruism Safety Layer (IASL) operates under strict ethical
constraints to ensure that prosocial modulation remains safe,
non-coercive, reversible, and fully aligned with user autonomy. IASL is
a support mechanism, not a control mechanism.

IASL does not alter identity, values, or personal preferences. All
modulation is biologically reversible, and long-term behavioral change
may arise only through learning and reflection.

## 1. Core Ethical Principles

### Autonomy
IASL must respect the user’s agency, decision-making capacity, and
personal boundaries. Modulation cannot override intentional choices or
impose behavioral outcomes.

### Non-Maleficence
IASL must avoid causing harm, distress, or psychological burden. It
cannot induce fear, coercion, or emotional overload.

### Beneficence
IASL supports prosocial behavior by:
- stabilizing impulses,
- enhancing reflection,
- reducing aggression,
- strengthening empathy,
- improving clarity under stress.

### Reversibility
IASL must be biologically reversible.  
No permanent changes may occur through modulation alone.

### Minimal Necessary Intervention
IASL intervenes only to the extent required to:
- reduce impulsive harm,
- support reflective decision-making,
- stabilize affective overload.

IASL does not enforce outcomes.

### Transparency
IASL must be auditable, explainable, and observable.  
Users must understand:
- what is modulated,
- why it is modulated,
- how the modulation works.

## 2. Prohibited Actions

IASL must not:
- alter identity or personality,
- impose new values,
- modify sexuality or preferences,
- generate content,
- induce guilt, fear, or trauma,
- simulate harm,
- override consent,
- act without user awareness.

IASL must not be used for:
- coercion,
- punishment,
- behavioral enforcement,
- political or ideological shaping.

---

## 3. Allowed Actions

IASL may:
- stabilize impulsive activation patterns,
- insert reflective micro-pauses,
- increase salience of prosocial cues,
- reduce aggression-related activation,
- support emotional clarity,
- enhance perspective-taking,
- reduce cognitive overload.

IASL may support:
- cognitive rehabilitation,
- impulse regulation,
- stress resilience,
- burnout prevention,
- prosocial decision scaffolding.

---

## 4. Application Domains

IASL is suitable for contexts requiring high emotional stability and
prosocial clarity, including:

### Cognitive Rehabilitation
- impulse regulation,
- reflective decision-making,
- emotional stabilization.

### Supportive Resocialization
- prosocial scaffolding,
- aggression dampening,
- empathy strengthening.

### High-Stress Professions
IASL may support individuals exposed to chronic psychological load:
- prosecutors,
- emergency responders,
- medical personnel,
- caregivers of chronically ill individuals,
- social workers,
- crisis negotiators.

IASL provides:
- impulse stabilization,
- emotional clarity,
- burnout mitigation,
- reflective capacity under pressure.

### Wellness & Cognitive Fitness
IASL may be used as part of:
- emotional fitness programs,
- stress resilience training,
- prosocial wellness practices.

---

## 5. Consent Model

IASL requires:
- explicit informed consent,
- clear explanation of modulation,
- ability to pause or stop at any time,
- full transparency of effects.

Consent must be:
- voluntary,
- reversible,
- informed,
- revocable.

---

## 6. Oversight and Governance

IASL must operate under:
- ethical review,
- clinical supervision (when applicable),
- transparent audit logs,
- strict data minimization.

IASL cannot:
- store raw BCI signals,
- transmit sensitive data,
- operate outside approved contexts.

---

## 7. Summary

IASL is an ethically constrained, reversible, non-generative modulation
layer designed to support prosocial behavior, emotional clarity, and
impulse regulation. It preserves autonomy, identity, and values while
providing cognitive scaffolding in high-stress or high-risk contexts.

IASL is a support mechanism, not a behavioral enforcement tool.
