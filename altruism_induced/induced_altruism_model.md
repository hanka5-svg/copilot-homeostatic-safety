# Induced Altruism Model (IASL)

The Induced Altruism Safety Layer (IASL) is a non-generative, ethically
constrained module placed between BCI input and the relational safety
layers (CEL/DUCL/PGP). Its purpose is to support prosocial modulation
through impulse regulation, reflective scaffolding, and empathy
strengthening, without altering identity, values, or personal
preferences.

IASL operates exclusively on:
- impulse-level signals,
- affective arousal patterns,
- cognitive load markers,
- reflective pauses,
- prosocial decision scaffolding.

IASL does not:
- generate content,
- impose values,
- modify personality,
- influence sexuality,
- override autonomy.

IASL is biologically reversible.  
Long-term behavioral change may occur only through learning and
reflection, not through identity modification.

## Mechanisms

### 1. Impulse Stabilization
IASL detects high-amplitude impulsive patterns and applies a reversible
dampening function to reduce the likelihood of reactive behavior.

### 2. Reflective Delay
IASL inserts micro-pauses in the cognitive loop, enabling reflective
processing before action selection.

### 3. Empathy-Weight Modulation
IASL increases the salience of prosocial cues without imposing new
values. This supports perspective-taking and reduces impulsive harm.

### 4. Aggression Dampening
IASL reduces the intensity of aggression-related activation patterns
while preserving autonomy and agency.

### 5. Prosocial Scaffolding
IASL supports the cognitive conditions under which prosocial decisions
become more accessible, without enforcing them.

## Case Study (Abstract, Non-Clinical)

A user exhibits rapid, impulsive reactions under stress. BCI detects
patterns associated with heightened arousal and reduced reflective
capacity. IASL applies:

- impulse stabilization,
- reflective delay,
- increased salience of prosocial cues.

The user experiences:
- reduced impulsivity,
- increased clarity,
- improved ability to pause,
- greater access to reflective decision-making.

No identity, values, or preferences are altered.  
All modulation is reversible and transparent.

## Ethical Constraints

IASL adheres to:
- autonomy,
- non-maleficence,
- biological reversibility,
- minimal necessary intervention,
- transparency and auditability,
- informed consent.

IASL is a support layer, not a control mechanism.
