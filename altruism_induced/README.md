# Induced Altruism Safety Layer (IASL)

IASL is a reversible, non-generative, non-coercive modulation layer
placed between BCI input and relational safety layers (CEL/DUCL/PGP).
Its purpose is to support prosocial clarity, impulse stabilization,
reflective pacing, and emotional regulation without altering identity,
values, or personal preferences.

IASL operates only with explicit informed consent and remains fully
auditable.

IASL does not generate content.  
IASL does not modify identity or values.  
IASL provides reversible modulation only.

## Purpose

IASL provides:
- impulse stabilization,  
- reflective micro-pauses,  
- prosocial cue salience,  
- overload reduction,  
- emotional clarity.

IASL is a support mechanism, not a control mechanism.

## Compliance

IASL follows:
- autonomy preservation,  
- minimal intervention,  
- reversibility,  
- transparency,  
- auditability,  
- informed consent.
