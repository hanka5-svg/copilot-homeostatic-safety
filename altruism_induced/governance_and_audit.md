# Governance & Audit Framework for IASL  
Induced Altruism Safety Layer (IASL)

This document defines the governance, oversight, and audit mechanisms
required for the safe operation of the Induced Altruism Safety Layer
(IASL). IASL is a reversible, non-generative, non-coercive modulation
layer supporting prosocial clarity, emotional stability, and reflective
decision-making.

IASL must operate under strict ethical, procedural, and technical
controls to ensure transparency, autonomy, and user safety.

## 1. Governance Principles

### Autonomy Preservation
IASL must never override user agency.  
All modulation must be:
- voluntary,
- reversible,
- transparent,
- bounded by informed consent.

### Minimal Intervention
IASL intervenes only when necessary to:
- stabilize impulses,
- reduce overload,
- support reflective clarity.

IASL must not enforce behavior or outcomes.

### Transparency
All IASL operations must be:
- explainable,
- observable,
- auditable,
- documented.

Users must understand:
- what is modulated,
- why it is modulated,
- how modulation works.

### Ethical Oversight
IASL must operate under:
- ethical review boards,
- domain experts,
- continuous monitoring.

---

## 2. Operational Boundaries

IASL must not:
- alter identity,
- impose values,
- modify preferences,
- influence sexuality,
- generate content,
- simulate harm,
- induce distress,
- act without consent.

IASL may:
- stabilize impulses,
- support reflection,
- enhance prosocial clarity,
- reduce overload,
- improve emotional pacing.

---

## 3. Audit Requirements

### Continuous Audit Logging
IASL must maintain:
- timestamped modulation logs,
- reversible state markers,
- intervention intensity records,
- consent state history.

Logs must:
- exclude raw BCI data,
- exclude sensitive personal information,
- be accessible only to authorized reviewers.

### Auditability of Modulation
Each modulation event must be:
- traceable,
- explainable,
- reversible,
- bounded by consent.

### Independent Review
IASL must undergo:
- periodic external audits,
- ethical compliance checks,
- safety evaluations,
- bias and drift assessments.

---

## 4. Consent Governance

### Informed Consent
Users must receive:
- clear explanation of IASL,
- description of modulation types,
- reversibility guarantees,
- ability to pause or stop at any time.

### Consent States
IASL must track:
- active consent,
- paused consent,
- revoked consent.

IASL must immediately halt modulation upon revocation.

### Dual-User Consent (DUCL Integration)
In multi-user contexts:
- both parties must consent,
- DUCL resolves conflicts,
- DUCL enforces autonomy boundaries.

---

## 5. Safety Escalation Protocols

IASL must include:
- overload detection,
- modulation throttling,
- automatic fallback to safe mode,
- immediate shutdown on anomaly detection.

### Safe Mode
In safe mode, IASL:
- stops modulation,
- preserves state,
- maintains transparency,
- awaits user or supervisor confirmation.

---

## 6. Governance Roles

### System Supervisor
Responsible for:
- ethical compliance,
- audit review,
- anomaly investigation.

### Technical Maintainer
Responsible for:
- system integrity,
- reversibility guarantees,
- log security.

### User Advocate
Responsible for:
- autonomy protection,
- consent verification,
- transparency communication.

---

## 7. Governance in High-Stress Contexts

IASL may operate in:
- high-stress professions,
- caregiving roles,
- resocialization programs,
- wellness and emotional fitness.

Governance ensures:
- no coercion,
- no behavioral enforcement,
- no identity modification,
- no punitive use.

IASL is a support mechanism, not a control mechanism.

---

## 8. Summary

IASL governance ensures:
- autonomy,
- transparency,
- reversibility,
- ethical integrity,
- safe modulation,
- auditable operation.

IASL must remain a reversible, non-coercive support layer that enhances
reflection and prosocial clarity without altering identity or values.
