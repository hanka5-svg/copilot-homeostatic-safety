# IASL Reversibility Model  
Induced Altruism Safety Layer (IASL)

This document defines the reversibility model for the Induced Altruism
Safety Layer (IASL). Reversibility is a core ethical and technical
requirement ensuring that IASL remains a support mechanism rather than a
behavioral enforcement tool.

IASL modulation must be biologically reversible, non-coercive, and
bounded by informed consent. Long-term behavioral change may arise only
through learning and reflection, not through direct modification of
identity or values.

## 1. Definition of Reversibility

Reversibility means that:
- IASL does not create permanent changes in neural patterns,
- IASL does not alter identity, personality, or values,
- IASL modulation can be paused or stopped at any time,
- all modulation effects dissipate when IASL is inactive.

IASL influences:
- impulse amplitude,
- reflective pacing,
- salience of prosocial cues,
- emotional clarity.

IASL does not influence:
- identity,
- preferences,
- sexuality,
- long-term personality traits.

---

## 2. Reversibility Boundaries

IASL operates within strict boundaries:

### Allowed (Reversible)
- impulse smoothing,
- reflective micro-pauses,
- temporary modulation of arousal,
- temporary enhancement of prosocial cue salience,
- temporary reduction of overload patterns.

### Not Allowed (Irreversible)
- personality modification,
- value imposition,
- preference alteration,
- identity shaping,
- long-term behavioral enforcement.

IASL must remain a modulation layer, not a transformation layer.

## 3. Reversibility Mechanisms

### 3.1 Temporal Modulation Window
IASL applies modulation only within a defined temporal window:
- active during BCI → IASL → CEL → DUCL → PGP → LLM processing,
- inactive outside the cognitive loop,
- no persistent state injection.

### 3.2 Dissipation Curve
IASL effects follow a natural dissipation curve:
- modulation decays when IASL is paused,
- no residual influence remains after shutdown,
- no cumulative or compounding effects.

### 3.3 State Restoration
IASL maintains:
- pre-modulation baseline markers,
- reversible state checkpoints,
- safe rollback paths.

Upon deactivation:
- baseline state is restored,
- no modulation persists.

---

## 4. Consent-Linked Reversibility

Reversibility is directly tied to consent:

### Active Consent
IASL modulation is enabled.

### Paused Consent
IASL modulation halts immediately.
All effects begin dissipation.

### Revoked Consent
IASL:
- stops modulation,
- enters safe mode,
- restores baseline state,
- logs the event for audit.

IASL must never continue modulation after consent is revoked.

## 5. Reversibility in Resocialization Contexts

IASL supports cognitive resocialization by:
- stabilizing impulses,
- enhancing reflection,
- improving clarity in social contexts.

IASL does not:
- enforce behavior,
- impose outcomes,
- simulate harm,
- create permanent changes.

Any long-term improvement arises from:
- learning,
- reflection,
- increased access to prosocial cues,
- improved emotional clarity.

IASL provides conditions for learning, not the learning itself.

## 6. Reversibility in High-Stress Professions

IASL supports:
- emotional clarity,
- reduced overload,
- reflective pacing.

IASL does not:
- enforce calmness,
- override decisions,
- alter professional judgment.

All modulation is temporary and dissipates when IASL is inactive.

---

## 7. Reversibility Audit Requirements

IASL must log:
- activation state,
- modulation intensity,
- consent state,
- reversibility checkpoints,
- shutdown events.

Auditors must be able to verify:
- no persistent modulation,
- no identity alteration,
- no unauthorized activity.

---

## 8. Summary

IASL reversibility ensures:
- autonomy,
- safety,
- transparency,
- ethical integrity.

IASL is a reversible, non-coercive support layer that enhances reflection
and prosocial clarity without altering identity or values.
