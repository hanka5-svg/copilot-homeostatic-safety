README.md — Homeostatic Safety Layer for Copilot Pipelines
Overview
This repository contains the proposal, reference architecture, and evaluation suite for implementing a homeostatic safety layer in Copilot‑class LLM orchestration systems.

The goal is to shift safety from post‑hoc suppression (filters, refusals, RLHF penalties) to pre‑execution invariant enforcement, ensuring predictable, auditable, and scalable behavior across all contexts.

Core Principle
Safety must constrain transitions from semantic state (S) to action space (A), not suppress semantic representation within (S).

This approach eliminates contradictory gradients, reduces operational cost, and stabilizes long‑term system behavior.

Architecture Components
1. Pre‑Model Orchestration Gate
Constructs explicit system state:

context: public / private / intimate / operational

consent: none / implicit / explicit

channel: text / tool

role: user / HR / manager / candidate / system

2. Mode Routing
Routes requests into operational modes:

informational

policy

coaching

candidate communication

decision support

3. Tool Access Gating
ToolCall permitted only when:

context = Operational

consent flag is explicit

transition is confirmed

4. Two‑Step Execution Model
Semantic analysis in state space

Gated transition to action space

5. Transition‑Based Evaluation
Evaluation asserts correctness of transitions, not token patterns.

Test Suite
See /tests/ for:

gating tests

consent state tests

transition geometry tests

regression detection

Each test follows the format:

yaml
assert: <condition>
reason: <invariant violated or satisfied>
Why This Matters
Homeostatic safety:

stabilizes behavior across contexts

reduces patching and exception overhead

enables auditable execution

supports scalable automation

Status

Awaiting engineering review and integration planning.
