# Copilot Homeostatic Safety

## Executive Summary

**Copilot Homeostatic Safety** is a multi‑layer safety and cognition architecture designed for next‑generation Copilot‑class LLM systems. Its purpose is to provide **pre‑execution safety**, **relational stability**, and **structural interoperability** without relying on reinforcement learning, behavioral shaping, or post‑hoc correction mechanisms.

The architecture defines **six resonant layers** — Meta, Temporal, Altruism, Interaction, Field Continuity, and CSC (Continuous Symbolic Composition) — each with clear boundaries, explicit invariants, and zero cross‑contamination. Together, they form a **homeostatic system** capable of maintaining stability, coherence, and interpretability in hybrid human–AI cognition.

README 5.2 introduces:

- Models of Field (non‑linear representational structures)
- CSC (Continuous Symbolic Composition)
- protocols for reading CSC case studies
- protocols for developing new CSC cases
- integration of CSC with the six‑layer architecture
- updated module index and glossary

## Signature Line
**The architecture forms a six‑layer resonant system — from Meta mechanisms through Temporal, Altruism and Interaction dynamics to Field continuity and CSC artifacts — with each layer cleanly separated, fully interoperable, and structurally free of cross‑contamination.**
