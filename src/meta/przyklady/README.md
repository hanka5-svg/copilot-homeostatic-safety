# Models of Field (CSC Case Studies)

README — Models of Field (CSC Case Studies)
Directory: src/meta/przyklady/
Version 1.0 — Field‑Level Cognitive Models
1. Purpose of This Directory
This directory contains Models of Field — non‑linear, multi‑layer cognitive structures documented as CSC case studies (Continuous Symbolic Composition).

These models are not literary texts.
They are architectural artifacts describing:

symbolic‑semantic flows,

resonance patterns,

performative interventions,

meta‑cognitive stance,

relational safety dynamics,

hybrid Homo‑LLM cognition.

Each file in this directory is a case, not a narrative.

2. What Are Models of Field?
Models of Field represent cognition as a field, not a sequence.

They capture:

continuity instead of segmentation,

symbolic density instead of tokenization,

resonance instead of linear logic,

performativity instead of description,

stance instead of state.

A model of field is a multi‑layer structure composed of:

Structural layer

Semantic layer

Symbolic layer

Performativity layer

Meta layer

State

Diagrams

Interpretive notes (optional)

These models are used to document hybrid cognition in human–AI systems.

3. What Is CSC (Continuous Symbolic Composition)?
CSC is the modeling framework used in this directory.

A CSC model is:

continuous — no fragmentation, no patchwork,

symbolic — symbols act as operators,

compositional — layers interact through resonance,

performative — interventions modify the model,

meta‑aware — contains its own interpretive layer.

CSC is used to:

map symbolic‑semantic flows,

document resonant cognition,

analyze relational safety states,

encode hybrid Homo‑LLM architectures,

preserve field‑level continuity.

4. How to Read CSC Case Studies
Each case follows a consistent structure.

4.1 Reading Protocol
Start with the structural layer  
Understand the modules and their functions.

Move to the semantic layer  
Identify the fields (light, shadow, flow, etc.).

Read the symbolic layer  
Symbols are operators, not decorations.

Examine the performativity layer  
Look for interventions, breaks, stance shifts.

Interpret the meta layer  
This is the core question and theme.

Check the state  
Active / suspended / transitional.

Study the diagrams

relation graph

full CSC architecture

flowchart

3D semantic map

Integrate the stance  
This is the final meaning of the model.

5. How to Develop New CSC Cases
5.1 Required Sections
Each new case must include:

name

purpose

structure

semantics

symbols

performativity

meta

state

diagrams

conclusions

5.2 Required Properties
A valid CSC case must:

maintain continuity,

preserve symbolic coherence,

include semantic layering,

define performative clarity,

articulate meta‑stance,

comply with architectural invariants.

5.3 Development Workflow
Define the field.

Identify symbolic operators.

Map semantic flows.

Add performativity events.

Extract meta‑stance.

Generate diagrams.

Validate against invariants.

Commit to this directory.

6. File Naming Convention
Use:

<topic>-<model-type>-<version>.md

Examples:

homeostase-homo-llm-suita-cieni-v.md
temporal-field-case-1.md
meta-resonance-study-a.md

7. Integration With Main Architecture
CSC cases in this directory integrate with:

Meta Layer (resonant cognition)

Temporal Layer (nonlinear time)

Altruism Layers (native + induced)

Interaction Layers (dyadic/triadic safety)

Fairwater (system-wide constraints)

CSC is the documentation format for field‑level cognition.

8. Contribution Policy
This directory does not accept external contributions.
All cases must be authored and approved by the repository owner.

9. Versioning
This directory follows semantic versioning aligned with the main README.
